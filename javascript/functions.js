/*
A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a
specific task.

Functions allow programmers to organise logic into named units
that can be reused multiple times throughout a program.

Similar to a recipe, you define the instructions once, give the
recipe a name, then reuse it whenever needed.

Remember that in a JavaScript program:
• Two different functions cannot have the same name.
• camelCase is the standard naming convention for JavaScript
  function names.

/*
.toUpperCase() is called a method because it belongs to a string
object.

Methods are functions that are associated with objects rather
than existing as standalone functions.
*/
console.log("Canada".toUpperCase());


/*
'greet' is the function name.

This is known as a function declaration.
*/
function greet() {
    console.log('\nHello.');
}


/*
This is an arrow function expression assigned to the variable
'greet'.

The variable name becomes the reference used to invoke the
function.

Arrow functions are declared with const keyword because it
prevents the function variable from being accidentally
reassigned:

greetArrow = "Not a function anymore.";
*/
const greetArrow = () => {
    console.log('\nHello.');
};


/*
This is a shorter arrow function expression.

Curly braces can be omitted when the function contains only a
single statement.
*/
const greetShort = () => console.log('\nHello.');


/*
greet() is invoked as a standalone function because it is called
directly rather than through an object.
*/
greet();


/*
Arrow functions do not define a function name directly inside the
function syntax.

Instead, they are commonly stored inside variables or constants.
*/


/*
Arrow functions were introduced in JavaScript to provide a more
concise syntax for writing functions.
*/


/*
Pass an anonymous arrow function as an argument to setTimeout().

The function executes after approximately 1,000 milliseconds
(1 second).
*/
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('\nHello.');
}, 1_000);


/*
This version uses a traditional anonymous function expression
instead of an arrow function.

Both approaches achieve the same result.
*/
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('\nHello.');
}, 1_000);
